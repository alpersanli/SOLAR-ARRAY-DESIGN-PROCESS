# SOLAR-ARRAY-DESIGN-PROCESS

#1) Determine requirements and constraints for power subsystem solar array design

#2) Calculate amount of power that must be produced by the solar arrays, Psa

#3) Select type of solar cell and  estimate power output, Po with the Sun normal to the surface of the cells

#4) Determine the beginning of life (BOL) power production capability, Pbol for the solar array

#5) Determine the end of life (EOF) power production capability, Peol for the solar array

#6) Estimate the solar array area, Asa required to produce the necessary power, Psa based on Peol an alternate approach
